  <div class="vertical-pad">
    A copy of the selected cohort would undergo a de-identification process. The de-identified data
    will be stored in a dedicated storage provisioned by your administrator. The copied cohort will
    be given a new name and description and is accessible via this application after the lengthy
    de-identification process is complete.
  </div>
  <div>
    <strong>Warning:</strong> You are about to de-identify data that may contain Protected Health
    Information (PHI). This process removes PHI from metadata, which often contains such
    information, but it does not remove PHI from any scanned images. Before sharing, review each
    image to ensure no PHI is visible, and verify that the metadata is free of PHI.

    Once the de-identification process starts it will run in the background and cannot be aborted.
    Check back with this application later to see it in your cohort list.
